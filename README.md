# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m NicolÃ¡s De GiÃ¡como

**Senior Software Engineer** at [Mercado Libre](https://www.mercadolibre.com), specialized in backend technologies, performance, and scalability.
I have over 10 years of experience building and maintaining high-impact systems for Latin Americaâ€™s leading e-commerce platform.

I work with technologies such as **Java, Go, Groovy, Python**, relational and NoSQL databases, search engines, and cloud platforms like **AWS, GCP, and Heroku**. My focus is on designing robust, scalable APIs that handle massive traffic, while ensuring maintainability and performance.

Outside of work, I enjoy pursuing new challenges â€” from solving programming puzzles to learning languages, reading, playing chess, and exploring science communication.
